# CLAUDE.md — domum-core-media

Operating rules for coding agents working on this repository.

This file holds **durable rules**. Current operational state — snapshot IDs,
repository identities, measurements, acceptance evidence, incident history —
belongs in `docs/`, never here. If a section here grows large, move it to
`.claude/rules/<topic>.md` or to repository documentation and leave a pointer.

## 1. Workspaces and fixed paths

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Development workspace | `/home/jfranco/src/domum-core-media-dev` |
| Production checkout | `/opt/domum-core-media` |
| Production config | `/opt/domum-core-media/config/domum-media.conf` |
| Secrets | `/etc/domum-core-media/secrets` |
| Protected durable data | `/srv/data` |
| Replaceable/reacquirable media | `/srv/media` |
| Local snapshots | `/srv/snapshots` |
| Runtime state | `/var/lib/domum-media` |
| Logs | `/var/log/domum-media` |

- All development happens in the development workspace.
- **Never treat the production checkout as a development workspace.** Do not
  edit, branch, experiment, or leave drift in `/opt/domum-core-media`.
- **Never copy production secrets into the development checkout**, into tests,
  into fixtures, or into any file that git can see.

---

## 2. Data safety

`/srv/data` is the highest-value local data tier (family photo library and
application state). Do not delete, migrate, restructure, bulk-modify, or
experiment on it without explicit operator approval.

`/srv/media` is intentionally replaceable/reacquirable. That is a statement
about recovery cost, **not** blanket permission to delete or restructure it.

Do not modify production data to test code. Use fixtures, temporary
directories, dry runs, or an isolated scratch restore location.

---

## 3. Btrfs truth

**Per-service Btrfs snapshot/rollback protection is currently DEGRADED / NOT
FUNCTIONAL.** The service paths the snapshot implementation expects are
ordinary directories rather than the required subvolumes, so service snapshots
silently skip.

Never:

- claim a skipped snapshot provides rollback protection;
- treat snapshot success as proven merely because `/srv/data` itself is Btrfs;
- use the current snapshot layer to justify a risky deployment.

Operations that depend on a snapshot for rollback (stateful image update,
Immich bundle apply, `immich reset-db`) **refuse to run** when no snapshot could
be created. `SNAPSHOT_POLICY=WARN` is the deliberate, documented override; it
lets the operation proceed without rollback protection and does not create any.
Never re-introduce a call site that downgrades a failed snapshot to a warning or
swallows it — `tests/snapshot-safety-gate-smoke.sh` enforces this.

Btrfs migration or restructuring is a separate high-risk project requiring
explicit operator approval. Do not start it opportunistically.

---

## 4. Image update safety

`domum-media-image-refresh.timer` is intentionally **disabled and inactive**
until the update/apply/rollback pipeline has been audited and proven safe.

- Do not re-enable it.
- Do not deploy locally staged image candidates merely because newer images
  exist.
- Image discovery, pulling, and staging must never automatically imply
  deployment.

---

## 5. Production deployment

**Merging to GitHub `main` is not a production deployment.** Landing code on
`main` is a normal development operation; changing `/opt/domum-core-media` or
anything running on the host is a separate boundary with its own approval.

There is **no blanket-trusted deployment command.** In particular, do not treat
`domum-media update` as automatically the safest mechanism: `update`, `apply`,
`converge_local_installation`, the installer, image refresh, backup gates,
health gates, and rollback paths all still require a dedicated safety audit.

Until that audit is complete, a production-changing deployment must:

- be change-specific, with minimal blast radius;
- avoid application/container recreation unless genuinely necessary;
- preserve rollback material;
- state exactly what will change before it changes;
- use narrow installation where appropriate;
- be verified in production afterwards.

**Stop at the actual risk boundary and present the deployment plan** for any
production change that requires root or could affect running services.

Routine development, tests, git, PRs, CI, documentation, and read-only
production inspection do **not** need repeated approval.

---

## 6. Restic safety

The canonical cloud Restic repository is production recovery infrastructure.

Do not manually run, without explicit approval:

- `forget`, `prune`, `repair`
- repository deletion, migration, or reinitialization
- adoption of an existing production repository
- destructive unlock/recovery operations

Do not change retention policy without explicit approval.

**Important nuance:** configured and scheduled production behavior already
invokes Restic retention operations. Its existence is *not* authorization to
manually trigger, modify, or redesign it. Inspect and report existing behavior
accurately; do not conflate "the schedule does this" with "I may do this".

Historical or malformed Restic repositories are **evidence**. Do not modify or
delete them without a separate, approved cleanup plan.

Never expose Restic passwords or private keys in output, git, documentation,
or tests.

---

## 7. Immich and database safety

Immich is a primary reason this server exists.

The PostgreSQL backup artifact is the **validated atomic dump**, not raw live
PostgreSQL storage.

Do not:

- treat or manipulate live PostgreSQL files as backup artifacts;
- import a database into production for testing;
- reset the Immich database;
- overwrite known-good recovery artifacts without preserving them first;
- recreate the Immich stack merely to validate code.

Scratch restore testing must stay isolated from production paths.

---

## 8. Git and development workflow

```
inspect → reproduce → develop → test → focused commit → push branch → PR → CI
→ review → merge → controlled production deployment when appropriate → verify
```

- **Never push directly to `main`.** Prefer focused branches and commits.
- `git` and `gh` are authenticated on this server — use them directly. Do not
  ask the operator to perform routine GitHub operations from another machine.
- **Never discard another agent's uncommitted work.** Before changing an
  unfamiliar dirty worktree, understand it and preserve it. Prefer a separate
  `git worktree` over stashing, resetting, or discarding.
- **Never wait on CI with an unbounded loop.** `gh pr checks <n>` returns an
  empty result once a PR is merged, so a loop waiting for `SUCCESS` or
  `FAILURE` never terminates and leaks a polling shell that outlives the task.
  Poll the run instead (`gh run view <id> --json status`), which reaches
  `completed`, and treat an empty or missing result as terminal rather than as
  "keep waiting".
- **Take the backup before the mutation, unconditionally.** When mutation-testing,
  `cp` the file on its own line — not chained after the command being tested. A
  short-circuited `&&` chain leaves the mutation applied and no way back.

---

## 9. Testing contract

`.github/workflows/compose-validate.yml` is the source of truth for validation.
Read it rather than relying on remembered commands. It currently expects:

- `bash -n` on the shell entrypoints
- `shellcheck --severity=warning`
- the hermetic smoke tests under `tests/`
- `systemd-analyze verify` on `systemd/*.service systemd/*.timer`
- `docker compose --env-file config/ci.env … config -q` with every fragment
  layered on `compose/base.yml`

Notes:

- `shellcheck` is **not installed on this host**; CI installs it. Do not report
  a shellcheck pass that did not run.
- `systemd-analyze verify` only checks unit syntax and that `ExecStart` binaries
  exist. It cannot detect a unit invoking a subcommand the CLI does not
  implement. `tests/unit-subcommands-exist-smoke.sh` is that separate
  verification, and it also reports host units absent from `systemd/` as drift.
  The live host carries a disabled `domum-media-hot-prune.service` invoking
  `domum-media hot prune`, a subcommand that no longer exists — which is what
  prompted the check.
- The smoke tests are hermetic (`mktemp -d` + cleanup trap) and safe to run.

Run the tests appropriate to the changed area. Add regression coverage with a
focused change when practical. **Do not claim success because a command exited
zero if the test did not actually exercise the intended behavior.**

---

## 10. Autonomy and sudo

This session runs directly on the N100. Do not tell the operator to SSH in.

Work autonomously on normal low-risk development. Do not stop after every step
to ask for approval. Attempt operations you have permission to perform.

`sudo` here requires interactive authentication that the agent cannot supply.
When an operation genuinely requires it, print:

```
OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED
```

followed by **only the smallest privileged command or block required**, then
resume autonomously once the result is provided.

Never resolve sudo friction by configuring broad passwordless sudo.

---

## 11. Stop conditions — explicit approval required

- deleting user data
- restructuring `/srv/data` or `/srv/media`
- Btrfs migration
- manual/destructive Restic operations
- repository deletion, migration, or historical Restic cleanup
- production database import or reset
- substantial application downtime
- broad container recreation
- application/image deployment
- re-enabling automatic image deployment
- fundamental storage architecture changes
- exposing or copying private keys or secrets
- configuring broad passwordless sudo
- large unrelated redesign with production impact

Do **not** manufacture approval gates for ordinary coding work.

---

## 12. Backlog

`backlog/` is planning information and evidence — **not an execution order and
not authority.** Do not execute tasks blindly by number or phase.

Reconcile each item against actual repository and production evidence before
acting. An item may be DONE, PARTIALLY DONE, STILL VALID, SUPERSEDED, in need
of REORDER, or replaced by something NEW.

Prefer the highest-value safe work given current evidence and project goals.
Do not create duplicate tasks for work already represented.

---

## 13. Relationship to `domum-core`

`domum-core` is the sibling/reference project. The goal is **"same operator
experience, different server responsibilities."**

Borrow Core's *patterns* for CLI ergonomics, reporting, status/checkup, backup
visibility, update safeguards, recovery workflows, and documentation
organization.

- Do not blindly copy its implementation.
- Do not modify `domum-core`.
- Do not copy its known defects.
- **`domum-core` is not currently available on this host.** Record that
  limitation when it matters; never invent or assume its behavior.

---

## 14. Current engineering phase — Operational Trust / Visibility

The goal is that the operator can ignore this server for days or weeks and then
quickly answer:

- Is the host healthy?
- Are containers healthy?
- Are backups current?
- Did scheduled jobs succeed?
- Is storage healthy?
- Is a reboot required?
- Are updates staged?
- Is snapshot protection actually available?
- Is anything approaching failure?

Trustworthy status / checkup / reporting comes **before** large new
infrastructure work. Truthfulness outranks coverage: a report that admits
"unknown" is correct; one that implies protection that does not exist is a
defect.

Cockpit, GPU work, Btrfs migration, application upgrades, historical repository
cleanup, and large observability stacks are later work unless explicitly
reprioritized.

---

## 15. Known open safety defects

Documented here because they constrain what is safe to do. Remove an entry when
it is actually fixed; keep the detail in `docs/`.

- **Deployment timers must never be auto-enabled.** `systemd/auto-enable.timers`
  is the single source of truth for what installation and convergence may
  enable, and `domum-media-image-refresh.timer` is deliberately absent from it.
  Never add a deploying timer to that file, and never reintroduce a hardcoded
  unit list next to a `systemctl enable` call — `sync_timer_overrides` is
  reached by `apply`, `init`, `configure`, and therefore by `update`, so a
  hardcoded list there lets routine convergence silently resume deployment.
  `tests/timer-auto-enable-safety-smoke.sh` enforces this.
- **`domum-media-btrfs-snapshot.service` runs `snapshot prune`, not
  `snapshot create`** — confirmed, and deliberately left that way for now.
  Its timer is enabled and fires weekly (Sun 04:30 +20m). It has never deleted
  anything, because no service path is a subvolume and the snapshot root is
  empty. **The first migration turns it into a live deleting job.** It now takes
  the operation lock, reports what it deleted, and fails when a delete fails.
  Do not repurpose it to create snapshots as a side effect of other work.
- Documentation may still describe protection that production does not have
  (snapshot coverage, backup targets that are not enabled). Verify claims
  against live evidence before repeating them.

---

## 16. Documentation boundaries

`CLAUDE.md` = durable operating rules. Detailed historical and operational
evidence belongs in repository documentation, which should preserve the P0
record: original backup failure and root causes, canonical cloud backup design,
accepted repository identity, atomic PostgreSQL dump behavior, recovery-pack
design, successful restore verification, runtime timeout/cache hardening, the
image-refresh safety freeze, the degraded Btrfs snapshot state, and the
historical repositories intentionally preserved.

**Never put credentials or secret values into documentation.**
